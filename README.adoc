= HID UPS Power Device Library for Arduino =

This library allows an Arduino board with USB capabilities to act as a HID-compliant UPS according to USB HID specifications. 
The library is useful if you want to build a smart UPS or other power device, which can report its state to the PC host
or perform power on/power off operations as necessary for your project.

For more information about USB HID specs please read https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/pdcv11.pdf

== Supported Arduinos ==
* Leonardo
* (Pro)Micro

== Setup & Usage ==
Setup is very simple. Just clone this repository to Arduino libraries, then upload the sketch UPS.ino 
from the /examples folder. Once upload is completed successfully you will find HID Device Battery in  
your system.

You migth need to change `bCapacityMode` from `2` (%) to `1` (mWh) if you want Windows to report battery capacity percentage on laptops that already has a battery installed (see https://github.com/abratchik/HIDPowerDevice/issues/11).

== Additional setup step on Linux hosts ==
Copy linux/98-upower-hid.rules file to the /etc/udev/rules.d/ folder , then reboot. This is required for
Linux device manager (udev) to recognize the Arduino board as UPS. 


== Tested on Operating Systems ==
* Mac OSX 10.14.6 Mojave
* Ubuntu 18.04.05 LTS 
* Windows 10
